## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the course of this challenge, I learnt CSS Grid and found out i don't need frameworks like BootStrap, Tailwind CSS and voila, you can see the Result. The greatness of CSS Grid in my opinion, is that you get to customise your page with little code and fast loading of the pages because there are no unnecessary styles in your CSS file.


```css
.container .row{
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(25vw, 1fr));
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to explore concepts of CSS Grid further in order to perfect it.
I might also continue using Tailwind or Bootstrap for faster development.
### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This helped me for Understanding CSS Grid. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) - Their CSS Grid section really helped me together with the first resource to understand CSS Grid. i recommend to anyone struggling in CSS Grid to check out this resource.
